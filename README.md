# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-for-BogleHead
Monte Carlo Simulation for BogleHead. This is a tool for all boglehead in Hong Kong to simulate the future return and risk. I will also include the withholding tax for Nonresident alien.

Unlike traditional Monte Carlo simulation for exchange traded fund or index. This is created especially for Nonresident alien with no US tax treaty.
Furthermore, I will include some Chiense index like CSI300 and HSI. In addition, I will include the taxation for Ireland-domiciled ETFs so that we can reduce the withholding tax from 30% to 15% of dividend.

Based on a few sources, Ireland does not withhold any taxes on capital gain or dividends paid by Ireland-domiciled UCITS ETFs. That seems to be true for Vanguard and iShares Dublin.

Monte carlo simulators can help drive the point home that success and outcome is not the only measure of whether or not a choice was good or not. Choices should not be assesed after their outcome. Instead, the risks and benefits should only be considered at the time the decision was made, without hindsight bias. A monte carlo simulator can help one visualize most or all of the potential outcomes to have a much better idea regarding the risk of a decision.
